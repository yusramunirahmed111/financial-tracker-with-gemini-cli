## Critical Money Handling Rule
**ALWAYS store monetary values as integers (paisa/cents) to avoid floating-point errors.**

```python
# Correct approach:
amount_paisa = 1250      # Store Rs 12.50 as 1250 paisa
display = amount / 100   # Display as Rs 12.50

# Wrong approach:
amount = 12.50           # Never use float for money!
```

## Transaction Categories
**Expenses**: Food, Transport, Shopping, Bills, Entertainment, Health, Other
**Income**: Salary, Freelance, Business, Investment, Gift, Other

# CLI Interaction
This repository uses questionary for dropdown-style selections in the terminal. The UI visual pieces (tables, panels) use Rich.
